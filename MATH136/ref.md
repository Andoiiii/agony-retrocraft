## Notation

Note that numbered subreferences like "Definition 1.2" refer to Topic 1, Definition 2.

We notate a vector in boldface as $\vb v = \mqty(1\\\\2\\\\3) = (1,2,3)^T \in \Z^3$.
The generic field $\F$ is either $\R$ or $\C$.

$S^+$ is the positive subset of $S$.
Set complements are denoted $A\setminus B$.
The range of a function $F$ is $R(F)$.
