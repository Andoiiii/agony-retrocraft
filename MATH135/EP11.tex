\qsection{Recommended Problems}{RP}

\question Let $z\in\C$. Prove that $(x-z)(x-\overline{z}) \in \R[x]$.


\question Prove that there exists a polynomial in $\Q[x]$ with the root $2-\sqrt 7$.


\question For each of the following polynomials $f(x) \in \F[x]$,

\question Let $g(x)=x^3+bx^2+cx+d\in\C[x]$ be a monic cubic polynomial.
Let $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$ be three roots of $g(x)$ such that
\[ g(x) = (x-z_1)(x-z_2)(x-z_3) \]
Prove that \begin{align*}
  z_1 + z_2 + z_3          & = -b \\
  z_1z_2 + z_2z_3 + z_3z_1 & = c  \\
  z_1z_2z_3                & = -d

\question Using the Rational Roots Theorem, prove that $\sqrt 3 + \sqrt 7$ is irrational.


\question \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Prove that for every prime $p$, there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ over $\Z_p$,
        of degree $p$, such that every element of $\Z_p$ is a root of $f(x)$.
  \item Prove that for every prime $p$, there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ over $\Z_p$,
        of degree $p$, which has no roots in $\Z_p$.
\end{enumerate}


\question Suppose $f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \in \C[x]$ with degree $n$.
We say $f(x)$ is \emph{palindromic} if the coefficients $a_j$ satisfy
\[ a_{n-j} = a_j \quad \text{for all} \quad 0 \leq j \leq n \]
Prove that \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item If $f(x)$ is a palindromic polynomial and $c \in \C$ is a root of $f(x)$,
        then $c$ must be non-zero, and $\frac{1}{c}$ is also a root of $f(x)$.
  \item If $f(x)$ is a palindromic polynomial of odd degree, then $f(-1) = 0$.
  \item If $\deg f = 1$ and $f(x)$ is a monic, palindromic polynomial, then $f(x) = x+1$.
\end{enumerate}


\qsection{Challenge}{C}

\question We call a polynomial primitive if the greatest common divisor of all of its coefficients is 1.
Show that the product of two primitive polynomials is again primitive.
