\begin{defn}[term]
  This is a \term{definition}! Terms are underlined.
\end{defn}

\begin{problem}
  This is a problem. These should motivate each section.
\end{problem}

\begin{xca}
  Exercises are like problems, but come at the end of a section to motivate learning.
  They have solutions.
\end{xca}

\begin{theorem}[important white guy]
  Theorems are also ``top-level'' boxes that stand out.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}[less important white guy]
  As the results get less important, the colour fades from purple to blue.
\end{lemma}

\begin{prop}
  Propositions are the least important, so get blue.
  It's giving Bootstrap infobox.
\end{prop}

\begin{claim}
  Claims are unimportant.
\end{claim}

\pagebreak
This is the top of the next page.

\begin{corollary}
  Corollaries are styled like remarks but with the blue-purple result colour.
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}
  This is something that is obviously true but detached from a result,
  so they don't get a cool result colour.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
  Examples are self-contained, and act like remarks.
\end{example}

\begin{conjecture}
  For the one time a conjecture shows up in a course.
\end{conjecture}
